          <h1>Porings</h1>
          <h2>Visual Analysis of Poring-like Creatures from Ragnarok Online</h2>
          <p class='intro'> Porings are gelatinous monsters from Ragnarok Online.
            For many players, small pink cute porings are the first monsters that they encounter in the game.
            It appears that there are many other porings scattered around the world of Rune Midgard.
            Moreover, although a few monsters bear other names, they look quite similar to porings in some way.
            So far, creatures of the poring family could be described as drop-shaped (to some degree) and
            moving by bouncing. However, the poring species drastically vary in their behavour and characteristics.

            Each genus of the poring family includes certain species. But even creatures of one species have slightly
            different characteristics!
            Poring 'types' (denoted by the smallest dots) combine creatures of one species sharing the same
            characteristics.

          <h3>About Ragnarok Online</h3>
          Ragnarok Online is a Korean MMORPG game based on the manhwa Ragnarok by Lee Myung-jin.
          The game was released by Gravity in 2002.<sup><a href="https://ragnarok.gamepedia.com/Ragnarok_Wiki">1</a></sup><br>
          Ragnarok is set in the World of Midgard consisting of three countries: Rune-Midgarts, the Schwarzwald
          Republic, and the Arunafeltz States.<br><br>
          Players are invited to create characters of the Norman race and explore the World through quests and events.
          On their jorney, players encounter various demons and creatures, porings among them.<br><br>
          To improve characters' characteristics, players have to level up their characters, upgrade their skills as
          well as choose their equipment.In general, stats and elements show combat abilities and features of characters or creatures.
        </div>
        <div class='stats'>
          <h3>Stats</h3>
          There are six basic stats that describe combat abilities:
          <sup><a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Ragnarok_Online/Leveling_Stats_and_Skills">2</a></sup><br>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="span-bold"> Strength</span> increases attack strength in melee combat and weight limit.<br>
            <li><span class="span-bold">Agility</span> increases attack speed and dodge rate.<br>
            <li><span class="span-bold">Vitality</span> increases physical defense, maximum HP and HP recovery rate.<br>
            <li><span class="span-bold">Intelligence</span> increases magic attack, magic defense and maximum SP.<br>
            <li><span class="span-bold">Dexterity</span> increases accuracy, ranged attack strength and minimum damage
              dealt, and lowers the cast time for some skills and spells.<br>
            <li> <span class="span-bold">Luck</span> increases Critical hits and perfect dodge rate.<br>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="element"></div>
        <h3>Elements</h3>
        Elements are properties that can strengthen, weaken, or nullify attacks when they interact.
        <sup><a href="https://irowiki.org/wiki/Element">3</a></sup><br>
        Every player and monster has an element and, with the exception of the Neutral element, every element has both
        strengths and weaknesses to other elements.<br>
        There are ten different elements: <span class="span-bold">Neutral, Water, Earth, Fire, Wind, Poison, Holy, Shadow, Ghost, Undead</span>.<br>
        Some attacks, such as the melee attacks of monsters, have no element and are completely unaffected by elemental
        modifiers.<br><br>
        Elements can be grouped into two types: attacking and defending. Defending elements are separated into four
        levels; the resistances and weaknesses of a defending element are amplified relative to its level. Attacking
        elements are not separated into levels.<br>
        Players have both an attacking and defending element but a player's defending element is always Level 1.<br>
        Monsters have only a defending element, but can inflict elemental attacks using skills.<br>
        The numbers on the diagram are in percentage; they show how much damage is dealt to a creature with a
        particular elemental attack.<br>
        <div class="combat">
          <h3>Derived Stats</h3>
          Derived stats are functions of basic stats.
          <sup><a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Ragnarok_Online/Leveling_Stats_and_Skills">2</a></sup><br>
          There are many of them in the game, for example, Maximum Hit Points (health),
          Maximum Spell Points (stamina), Attack Power (Atk), Magical Attack Power (MAtk), Degence (Def), Magical
          Degence (MDef), Accuracy, Dodge, Attack Speed etc.
